<b>Objective:</b> Analyze your Spotify top artists to create a dynamic, personalized playlist  
<b>Audience:</b> Those interested in music and learning Python!  
<b>Prerequisite:</b> You must have a [Spotify account](https://accounts.spotify.com/en/login?continue=https)  

#### Go [here](https://spotify-playlist-290119.uc.r.appspot.com/) to create a Spotify playlist and then ...
 
### Run the code yourself in a Jupyter Notebook!

1. Install Dependencies
    - [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
        - Use Git to save work at checkpoints and share your work 
    - Install <b>Python 3.7.3</b> (Other versions may not work... but you may get lucky!)
        - For Macs, check out the guide [here](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac)
        - For Windows/PCs, you can download Python 3.7.3 [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/python-3.7.3-amd64-webinstall.exe)
            - Optional: If you want to manage multiple versions of Python on your Windows machine, check out pyenv-win [here](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win)
2. Open Terminal (Mac) or CMD (Windows)
    - Navigate to a folder on your machine where you want to download the Git repo (i.e. this project). 
        - E.g. If you want to download to your "Documents" folder:
            - Type ```cd C:\Users\your_computer_name\Documents``` or ```cd /Users/your_computer_name/Downloads```
    - Install the Git repo:
        - Type ```git clone https://github.com/wjewell3/spotipy.git```
        - Step into the repo. Type ```cd spotipy```
    - Install the Python dependendencies
        - Type ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
    - Launch Jupyter Notebook 
        - A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive notebook to run code and see the outputs in-line
        - Type ```jupyter notebook```
    - Click on "Create Spotify Playlist Using Python.ipynb" to open the notebook and have fun!
