Analyze your liked and/or disliked Spotify songs to create a dynamic, personalized playlist. 

Create a new Spotify playlist based on your liked (i.e. hearted) songs. 
Find Spotify "featured playlist" songs (that refresh frequently) that share genres with your liked songs.
*Optionally* reverse weight any genres associated to songs in a playlist called "Dislikes".
Without liked songs, this tool will not work. 

Enhancement idea: optionally consume "Liked" playlists.
