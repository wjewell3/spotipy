Analyze your liked and/or disliked Spotify songs to create a dynamic, personalized playlist. 

## Prerequisite: 
You must have a [Spotify account](https://accounts.spotify.com/en/login?continue=https).

To run code yourself in Jupyter Notebook:
1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    - Use Git to save work at checkpoints and share your work 
2. Open Terminal (Mac) or CMD (Windows)
    - Navigate to a folder where you want to download the git repository. 
        - E.g. If you want to download to your Documents folder:
        - Type ```cd C:\Users\your_computer_name\Documents``` or ```cd /Users/your_computer_name/Downloads```
    - Next install the git repo (project) into your chosen folder:
        - Type ```git clone https://github.com/wjewell3/spotipy.git```
    - Install Python 3.7.3 (other versions may not work, but you may get lucky!)
        - For Macs, check out the guide [here](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac)
        - For Windows/PCs, you can download Python 3.7.3 [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/python-3.7.3-amd64-webinstall.exe)
        - Optional: If you want to manage multiple versions of Python on your Windows machine, check out pyenv-win [here](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win)
    - Next install the Python dependendencies needed for this project
        - Type ```pip install -r spotipy/requirements.txt```
    - Launch a jupyter notebook - this is an interactive notebook to run code and see the outputs inline
        - Type ```jupyter notebook```
    - Click on Create Spotify Playlist Using Python.ipynb to open the notebook and have fun!
